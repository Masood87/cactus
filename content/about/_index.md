My name is Masood Sadat, from Afghanistan living in Kabul. I am trained in economics but my interest transcends economics to all social sciences, technology and data science. In addition to my formal education, which I owe a lot of my knowledge to, I have been self-learning and teaching others topics in data analysis and data science since 2014. I start this website/blog to share custom analysis I carry out every now and then, R and Stata tips and tricks, and other related posts for anyone interested and for my future self.

Last year I created [**Afghanistan Data Hub**](http://afghanistandatahub.com) to upload useful data sets on Afghanistan. In the near future, I plan to move it to my personal website.
