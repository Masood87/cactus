      <description>In this post I am going to download tweets using twitteR package.
To being, you have to have a twitter account. If you do not have, create a twitter account on twitter.com.
 Create a twitter application on apps.twitter.com. There, you have to insert a number of information.
 Once, you created an application, you will have access to API Key and API Secret in the Keys and Access Tokens tab.</description>

      <description>Estimating linear regression Before starting, I am going to load a number of utility libraries for this session.
library(tidyverse) library(broom) library(plotly) A simple linear regression using mtcars dataset. I want to look at how weight of a car is associated with how many miles a car travels per gallon of gasoline–an indicator of fuel economy. I am going to look at their summary and scatter plot.</description>

      <description>One of the coolest things I have learned in R recently is creating a website with blogdown package. The blogdown websites are created and maintained from within R mostly, which is the best part about it if you are a R user. There are many sources that provide details and reasons for using blogdown, so I will not dwell on that. Instead, I am going to provide a brief and to-the-point tutorial on how to start your website with R and blogdown.</description>

      <description>In this post, we will explore visdat package to visualize missing values. Then, we will recreate a similar plot using ggplot2 package. Next, using the ggplot2 method, we will visualize other numeric or character values in a dataset. Finally, using the ggplot2 method, we will create a custom function that will plot any value in any dataset.
 There are many ways to inspect and find about missing values in a dataset.</description>
